# Me
I'm Cory Ness. 
I currently major at Kettering University as a Bachelors in Computer Science, taking a concentration in Cybersecurity and a minors in Computer Engineering.
I'm expected to graduate in Spring of 2021.

I've been working at Cross The Road Electronics as a software engineering intern since Summer of 2017, learning about robotics, API Development in Java, C++, and LabVIEW, and embedded development in C.
I've also been involved in customer support, API documentation, and testing of both new and old products.

If you'd like to contact me for any reason, shoot me an email at [coryness@tytan.rocks](mailto:coryness@tytan.rocks).

## Personal Github
My personal github account is [TytanRock](https://github.com/TytanRock).

I have multiple repos that range from old high school robotics to college level courses to personal projects that I'm working on.
I'd recommend looking at the repositories if you're currently enrolled at Kettering as a CS major, you'll probably find something that's useful.
As always, do not use the repositories to copy off them, but rather as an idea and possibly a means to double check your programs against something else that (probably) works.

My Github is probably the best way to see how I program and see the progression of my development.

## Robotics Organizations
I'm also the owner of the [De La Salle Robotics (7762)](https://github.com/De-La-Salle-Robotics) Github organization as the lead software mentor and am part of the [Killer Bees (33)](https://github.com/FRC33) organization as a graduated software student.
Both of these organizations are FRC teams using Git and Github as their version control system.

Killer Bees uses LabVIEW to program their robot, and the software that's inside their repository, especially between 2014 and 2017, showcases the stuff I did in high school.

De La Salle Robotics uses Java to program their robot, and the software showcased there is mostly representative of the students, however I led the design choice and helped with the more complicated algorithms.

## Work Github
I have a sperate Github account for my work, [CoryNessCTR](https://github.com/CoryNessCTR).
This account is used solely for work related activities at [CTR-Electronics](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/).

This Github account participates in various CTR repositories.
Anything posted by the account is posted by me, and it gives an idea of the progression I've had throughout my work experience, along with where I currently am at in work.

I have a chief delphi account, also [TytanRock](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/u/TytanRock/), that I will sometimes post on.
This is used mostly as a means to help others in the FRC community.

I participate heavily in FRC robotics, having the following resume:
 - 2014 - 2017: High school student a part of Killer Bees (33)
   - 2016: Participate as Software Pit Crew member
   - 2017: Participate as Lead Software Student and Operator of the robot

 - 2018: Software Mentor for Killer Bees (33)
 - 2019 - Present: Leadership Mentor for AutoPilots (7762)
   - Software Mentor
   - Electrical Mentor
   - Design Mentor

I also volunteer as a CSA at various robot competitions. 
Unfortunately I cannot volunteer as much as I'd like, due to commitments to school and my own robotics team.
Some events I've CSA'd at:
 - Southfield (2018, 2019)
 - Centerline (2018)
 - Milford (2018)
 - Jackson (2019)

If you participated in any of the above events and had a guy in an orange hat help you, it was probably me.
And as always, I'm happy to help any team as much as I can. Send me an email at coryness@tytan.rocks with any questions you have and I'll answer them as best I can.
