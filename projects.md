# School-Related Projects

## Research Project
I'm doing a research project with Professor Yunsheng Wang from Kettering's CS Department, involving MK5 DSRC units and communication between them in a V2V (vehicle to vehicle) and V2X (vehicle to infrastructure) style.

I'm also working on edge node computing in vehicles as a means of offloading computation-intensive programs to a dedicated computer.

## CS-203 Java and Algorithms III Projects
Java 3, CS-203, required some projects to be completed.
I cannot remember what I had to do in the class, as it was a year before I moved it into a Github Repo, however I wanted to add it to help others out if possible.
Repository is [here](https://github.com/TytanRock/CS-203-Assignments).

## CS-231 Programming Paradigms Projects
Programming Paradigms, CS-231, required multiple projects to be completed.
Those projects consisted of some C projects, and some Haskell projects.
Repository is [here](https://github.com/TytanRock/CS-231-Projects).

## CS-351 Cloud Computing Projects
Cloud Computing, CS-351, required some homework assignments to be completed.
They consisted of using Amazon Web Services to spin up EC2 instances and S3 buckets to process large quantities of data quickly.
Repository is [here](https://github.com/TytanRock/CS-351-CloudComputing)

## CS-451 Operating Systems Projects
Operating Systems, CS-451, required multiple low level C projects to be completed for class credit.
I have also taken on the added work of integrating Jenkins into every build of a project, to ensure I understand how Jenkins works and how to develop simple C unit tests.
Repository is [here](https://github.com/TytanRock/CS-451).

# Non-School Projects

## Home Server
I've set up a couple home servers to be used as network drives for computer backups for my family.

In addition to this, the servers run Jenkins, which continually scans my account for repositories that need to be built.
Jenkins is also working with a docker server, so that it can run docker containers with exactly what is needed for the development of an item.

## CAD-Work
I am familiar with Autodesk Inventor and Onshape for 3d CAD software, where I have designed a chess set, a [3d representation](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/89701ed42737cd73d5f612e3/w/dba0564388030888f467bf9d/e/9a8574c201287417260c4710) of the board game [Settlers of Catan](https://www.catan.com/), among other items.

I have printed out the chess set and the settlers of catan board game using a personal 3d printer, using ABS and PLA filament respectively.

I am also familiar with Autodesk Eagle, and have designed some PCB's for various personal projects.
