# School-Related Projects

## Research Project
I'm doing a research project with Professor Yunsheng Wang from Kettering's CS Department, involving MK5 DSRC units and communication between them in a V2V (vehicle to vehicle) and V2X (vehicle to infrastructure) style.

I'm also working on edge node computing in vehicles as a means of offloading computation-intensive programs to a dedicated computer.

## CS-231 Projects
My Programming Paradigms class, CS-231, requires multiple projects to be completed for class credit.

The projects include:
 - A **C** program that takes a line of words and reverses each word
   - IE: "Hello, this is a sentence!" -> ",olleH siht si a !ecnetnes"
 - A **C** program that mimics the linux program "cat", with significantly fewer tags
 - A **C** program that uses multiple programs and pipes them together to check the spelling of a block of text
 - A **Haskell** program that introduces us to Haskell by integrating a simple algorithm to an arbitrary problem
 - A **Haskell** program that checks the spelling of each word in a block of text, similar to the C spellcheck
 - A **Haskell** program that cheats at Hangman as it moves its "chosen" word to be part of the most common word family

## CS-451 Projects
My other programming class, Operating Systems, requires multiple projects to be completed for class credit.

Projects include:
 - A **C** program that scans the /proc directory for a specified PID, and replicates the PS output of that PID
 - A **C** program that forks children processes that find primes, and schedules them according to a priority table that is specified.

Beyond the required projects, this repo also integrates Jenkins as a CI on my home server.

# Non-School Projects

## Home Server
I've set up a couple home servers to be used as network drives for computer backups for my family.

They're also used for various other things I find interesting, such as setting up gaming servers for friends.

## CAD-Work
I have familiarity with Autodesk Inventor and 3D printing, making various items such as a Chess Set or storage items.
