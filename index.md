Congrats, you found my website.

This website's purpose is to put everything I'm involved in together.
That may be useful for you if you're an employer or someone trying to find my work.

Visit the [About](/about) section to read more about me.

The [Projects](/projects) section covers the projects I'm involved in.

And <a href="/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>  has a cover letter for potential employers.

Take a look around.
